## About myself
My major has never been related to information technology, but I have always been interested in this field of knowledge. I am English langauge teacher with some work experience, and I am a self-taught frontend developer with little knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JS.

I have been thinking of changing my profession for quite a long time. Now it seems to be a good chance to fulfill that aim.
*******************

## Work experience
Mainly my work experience is only in teaching English. I have been working as an EFL teacher in different work places. My last work place was a university where I worked as an EFL teacher.

This means I have no experience in coding but I am willig to learn and improve.
